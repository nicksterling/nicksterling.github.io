      <description>Environment Setup Account set up  Access to Pivotal Web Services  Target the Environment If you haven’t already, download the latest 0.6 release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.
NOTE: The Tanzu Application Service is not currently compatible with the latest 7.0 version of the cf cli. Please download the latest release of version 6.  Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry and follow the prompts</description>

      <description>Pushing to Cloud Foundry Push It! Clone or download the repo into a path Spring Music :
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME/spring-music  Push the application!
$ cf push  You should see output similar to the following listing. Language specific output has been omitted for clarity. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what’s happening:

      <description>Binding Cloudfoundry Services The Workshop application was designed to illustrate the ease with which data services can be bound to and utilized by applications running on Cloud Foundry. In this lab, we’ll be binding the application to a Postgres databases.
Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:
Create/Delete
 These operations create or delete instances of a service. For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.</description>

      <description>Operating your application Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy. In the next two labs we’ll explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry operations.
Scale the Application Up Now let’s increase the number of running application instances to 3. In each of the commands below replace workshop with the name of your deployed application:
$ cf scale -i 3 workshop Scaling app workshop in org DEMO / space gammon as nsterling@pivotal.</description>

Application Container and Network Monitoring with PCF Metrics PCF Metrics helps developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of critical data. Developers can see performance issues within two to three seconds, learn about events like an app crash as they occur, and look back in time to see what happened while they were away.</description>

      <description>Networking &amp;amp; Policies (Advanced) Target the Environment This example demonstrates communication (HTTP and UDP) between a frontend and backend applications using service discovery over the container network.
  Follow the earlier instructions to Get Environment Access
  Clone or download the repo into a path CF Networking Examples :
  Frontend The frontend allows you to test out container network communication via two methods:
 Connect to the backend via HTTP Connect to the backend via UDP  In either case, the response from the backend to the frontend will be rendered as a web page.</description>

      <description>Security Documentation PWS implements the following measures to mitigate against security threats:
 Minimizes network surface area Isolates customer apps and data in containers Encrypts connections Uses role-based access controls, applying and enforcing roles and permissions to ensure that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they have been granted access Ensures security of app bits in a multi-tenant environment Prevents possible denial of service attacks through resource starvation  For more details please see the security documentation: Security Documentation</description>
