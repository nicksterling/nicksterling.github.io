<p>Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy. In the this labs we’ll continue to explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry application operations.</p>
<h2 id="application-container-and-network-monitoring-with-pcf-metrics">Application Container and Network Monitoring with PCF Metrics</h2>
<p>PCF Metrics helps developers better understand the health and performance of their apps by providing a near real-time view of critical data. Developers can see performance issues within two to three seconds, learn about events like an app crash as they occur, and look back in time to see what happened while they were away.</p>
<p>For developers, there’s nothing to install or configure, just select an app and watch the data stream.</p>
<p>PCF Metrics provides the following data on app health and performance</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Container metrics: CPU, memory, and disk percentages (updated every 30 seconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP metrics: requests per second, HTTP errors per second, and request latency (updated every second)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>App events: create, update, start, stop, and crash (updated as they happen)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tailing-application-logs">Tailing Application Logs</h2>
<p>One of the most important enablers of visibility into application behavior is logging. Effective management of logs has historically been very difficult. Cloud Foundry’s log aggregation components simplify log management by assuming responsibility for it. Application developers need only log all messages to either STDOUT or STDERR, and the platform will capture these messages.</p>
<h3 id="for-developers">For Developers</h3>
<p>Application developers can view application logs using the CF CLI.</p>
<p>Let’s view recent log messages for the application. In each of the commands below replace workshop with the name of your deployed application:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf logs workshop --recent
</code></pre>
<p>Here are two interesting subsets of one output from that command:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-13T14:45:39.40-0600 [RTR/0]      OUT cf-scale-boot-stockinged-rust.cfapps.io - [13/02/2015:20:45:39 +0000] &quot;GET /css/bootstrap.min.css HTTP/1.1&quot; 304 0 &quot;http://cf-scale-boot-stockinged-rust.cfapps.io/&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.111 Safari/537.36&quot; 10.10.66.88:50372 x_forwarded_for:&quot;50.157.39.197&quot; vcap_request_id:84cc1b7a-bb30-4355-7512-5adaf36ff767 response_time:0.013115764 app_id:7a428901-1691-4cce-b7f6-62d186c5cb55

    An “Apache-style” access log event from the (Go)Router

    An API log event that corresponds to an event as shown in cf events

    A DEA log event indicating the start of an application instance on that DEA.

</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, Cloud Foundry’s log aggregation components capture both application logs and CF component logs relevant to your application. These events are properly interleaved based on time, giving you an accurate picture of events as they transpired across the system.</p>
<p>To get a running “tail” of the application logs rather than a dump, simply type(replace workshop with the name of your deployed application):</p>
<pre><code>$ cf logs workshop
</code></pre>
<p>You can try various things like refreshing the browser and triggering stop/start events to see logs being generated.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-application-events">Viewing Application Events</h2>
<p>Cloud Foundry only allows application configuration to be modified via its API. This gives application operators confidence that all changes to application configuration are known and auditable. It also reduces the number of causes that must be considered when problems arise.</p>
<p>All application configuration changes are recorded as events. These events can be viewed via the Cloud Foundry API, and viewing is facilitated via the CLI.</p>
<p>Take a look at the events that have transpired so far for our deployment of workshop:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cf events workshop
    Getting events for app workshop in org TELCO / space gammon as admin...

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events are sorted newest to oldest, so we’ll start from the bottom. Here we see the app.create event, which created our application’s record and stored all of its metadata (e.g. memory: 512).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The app.map-route event records the incoming request to assign a route to our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This app.update event records the resulting change to our applications metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This app.update event records the change of our application’s state to STARTED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember scaling the application up? This app.update event records the metadata change instances: 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And here’s the app.crash event recording that we encountered a crash of an application instance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explicitly ask for the application to be stopped:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf stop workshop
Stopping app workshop in org TELCO / space gammon as admin...
OK
</code></pre>
<p>Now, examine the additional app.update event:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf events workshop
