<p>The Workshop application was designed to illustrate the ease with which data services can be bound to and utilized by applications running on Cloud Foundry. In this lab, we’ll be binding the application to a Postgres databases.</p>
<p>Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:</p>
<p><strong>Create/Delete</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These operations create or delete instances of a service. For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bind/Unbind</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-review">A Bit of Review</h2>
<p>Your instance of the sample sping-music should not be running after the steps completed in the previous lab. Make sure to change to the spring-music application directory. For this lab we will be using the Java application. Redeploy the application:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cf push
</code></pre>
<p>After the application deploys and starts, visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI. Currently, this data is being retrieved from an in-memory HSQL database</p>
<h2 id="the-services-marketplace">The Services Marketplace</h2>
<p>There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Platform. The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cf marketplace
</code></pre>
<p>and you’ll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions. On Pivotal Platform, the “free” tier of plans is normally the first one listed.</p>
<p>The second way is specific to Pivotal Platform’s Apps Manager UI. If you haven’t already, login to it by visiting https://{your_org_pcf_api_endpoint}</p>
<p>Click on the <em>‘Marketplace’</em> link and you’ll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-binding-to-a-service-instance">Creating and Binding to a Service Instance</h2>
<p>Let’s begin by creating a Postgres service instance. From the Apps Manager UI service marketplace, select ElephantSQL for Pivotal Platform, select the tiny turtle plan, and provide an instance name. In the drop-down list next to Bind to App select your spring-music application.</p>
<p>Notice the admonition to Use &lsquo;cf restage&rsquo; to ensure your env variable changes take effect. Let’s take a look at the environment variables for our application. We can do this by viewing to the homepage of the application. Here we will see a printout of the environment information. Take note of what is contained in the section Bound Services. It’s an empty JSON document!</p>
<p>Now let’s restage the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application. (<em>In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only restarting the application via cf restart spring-music. A restage is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.</em>)</p>
<pre><code>    $ cf restage spring-music
</code></pre>
<p>Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the Wokshop application loaded. You’ll notice now we have information that could be used to connect to a DB. In fact, our data is now being retrieved from that Postgres database!</p>
<pre><code>&quot;VCAP_SERVICES&quot;:
{
   &quot;p-mysql&quot;:[
      {
         &quot;name&quot;:&quot;adam-db&quot;,
         &quot;label&quot;:&quot;p-mysql&quot;,
         &quot;tags&quot;:[
            &quot;mysql&quot;,
            &quot;relational&quot;
         ],
         &quot;plan&quot;:&quot;100mb&quot;,
         &quot;credentials&quot;:{
            &quot;hostname&quot;:&quot;10.68.105.55&quot;,
            &quot;port&quot;:3306,
            &quot;name&quot;:&quot;cf_226845a3_1982_44ac_92b9_4b149af56bbc&quot;,
            &quot;username&quot;:&quot;n67hpBOnKlsPUjKn&quot;,
            &quot;password&quot;:&quot;hUa4WSrq2hPtBsuk&quot;,
            &quot;uri&quot;:&quot;mysql://n67hpBOnKlsPUjKn:hUa4WSrq2hPtBsuk@10.68.105.55:3306/cf_226845a3_1982_44ac_92b9_4b149af56bbc?reconnect=true&quot;,
            &quot;jdbcUrl&quot;:&quot;jdbc:mysql://10.68.105.55:3306/cf_226845a3_1982_44ac_92b9_4b149af56bbc?user=n67hpBOnKlsPUjKn&amp;password=hUa4WSrq2hPtBsuk&quot;
         }
      }
   ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>You may also verify your service was provisioned in the Apps Manager UI by clicking on your application and selecting the Services tab.</p>
<p>You should now see the service created in step 1 listed.</p>
<p>You may also verify your service was provisioned using the CLI:</p>
<pre><code>$ cf services
</code></pre>
<p>You should now see the service created in step 1 listed and your application listed as a bound app.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations! You have just bound your first Cloud Foundry Service!</strong></p>
